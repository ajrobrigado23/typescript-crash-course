Title: "typescript-crash-course"

# Learning TypeScript 🚀

This repository documents my journey of learning TypeScript.
I’m using it as a crash course to explore the language, practice concepts, and build confidence transitioning from JavaScript to TypeScript.

## 📖 Topics I’m Learning

* TypeScript setup and configuration
* Primitive types and type inference
* Arrays, tuples, and enums
* Functions and type annotations
* Interfaces and type aliases
* Classes and object-oriented features
* Generics
* Modules and namespaces
* TypeScript with Node.js

## 📂 Structure

* `/examples` → code snippets for each topic
* `/examples` → small exercises and mini-projects to apply learning
* `/examples` → markdown notes for quick reference

## 🎯 Goal

By the end of this crash course, you’ll be able to confidently use TypeScript in your projects and write type-safe, maintainable code.
