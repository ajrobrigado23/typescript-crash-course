# TypeScript Crash Course ðŸš€

This repository documents my journey of learning **TypeScript**.  
Iâ€™m using it as a crash course to explore the language, practice concepts, and build confidence transitioning from JavaScript to TypeScript.

## ðŸ“– Topics I'm Learning

- TypeScript setup and configuration
- Primitive types and type inference
- Arrays, tuples, and enums
- Functions and type annotations
- Interfaces and type aliases
- Classes and object-oriented features
- Generics
- Modules and namespaces
- TypeScript with Node.js

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `/examples`: Code snippets for each topic.
- `/examples`: Small exercises and mini-projects to apply learning.
- `/examples`: Markdown notes for quick reference.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

By the end of this crash course, youâ€™ll be able to confidently use TypeScript in your projects and write type-safe, maintainable code.
